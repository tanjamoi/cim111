            <p>Miami has so much to offer and it is definitely one of my favorite cities in the US and the world. Beautiful beaches, tropical vibes, diverse arts and music - whatever you're looking for, you will find it in this vibrant city. I can't get enough of it and whenever I go explore, I fall in love with something new. Of course, school is my priority number one, but I have so many options how to spend my free time here. I'm very active and spend most of my days outside. I even found a new outdoor sport that I love. Kiteboarding is incredibly fun and balances me when I feel like I'm working 24/7.</p>

            <p>Just like Miami, the University has so much to offer. UM has hundreds of clubs and organizations that students can join and I'm involved in three of them. Trying to make the most of my college experience, I joined the sorority Zeta Tau Alpha, the professional business fraternity Alpha Kappa Psi, and the kiteboarding club. Especially the two organizations make me very happy. In Alpha Kappa Psi, I surround myself with driven and incredibly talented people and in my sorority, I've found a group of amazing and caring young women who know what they want, give back to the society, and know how to have a good time.</p>
