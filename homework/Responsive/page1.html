            <p>Growing up in the alpine region of Germany, I spent my childhood outdoors exploring my environment. This is the reason why I feel such a deep connection to forests and mountains of Bavaria, and why I enjoy outdoor sports so much. I love skiing, equestrian, hiking and rock climbing - and I'm not going to lie - I relly miss all of these things in Miami. Something I also miss is my culture, which I consider to be part of my identity. Being from Bavaria, the southern and "traditional" part of Germany, I grew up with a lot of traditions, such as the Oktoberfest, that have become a part of me. Overall, I am problbly the most German person you will ever meet. I love soccer, beer and cars - and I can be brutally honest.</p>

            <p>Skiing is definitely my greatest passion. Skiing is part of being a true Bavarian and everytime I go with my friends or family it's a magical experience. I love waking up at sinrise to hike up the mountain on the lookout for the perfect slope with deep snow. I live for the moment when you look down on the untouched mountainside, plough through the white powder and leave the first track in the snow. At noon, we usually take a short break and eat alpine dishes before we head out again. After a long day of skiing, warming up in the sauna or whirlpool is the perfect way to recharge.</p>
