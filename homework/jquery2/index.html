            <h4>Senso-Ji</h4>
            <p>Tokyo’s most visited temple enshrines a golden image of Kannon (the Buddhist goddess of mercy), which, according to legend, was miraculously pulled out of the nearby Sumida-gawa by two fishermen in AD 628. The image has remained on the spot ever since but is never on public display. The present structure dates from 1958. Entrance to the temple complex is via the fantastic, red Kaminari-mon (雷門; Thunder Gate) and busy shopping street Nakamise-dōri.</p>

          <h4>Shibuya Crossing</h4>
          <p>Rumoured to be the busiest intersection in the world (and definitely in Japan), Shibuya Crossing, is like a giant beating heart, sending people in all directions with every pulsing light change. Perhaps nowhere else says ‘Welcome to Tokyo’ better than this. Hundreds of people – and at peak times said to be over 1000 people – cross at a time, coming from all directions at once yet still managing to dodge each other with a practised, nonchalant agility.</p>

          <h4>Meiji-Jingu</h4>
          <p>Tokyo’s grandest Shintō shrine is dedicated to the Emperor Meiji and Empress Shōken, whose reign (1868–1912) coincided with Japan's transformation from isolationist, feudal state to modern nation. Constructed in 1920, the shrine was destroyed in WWII air raids and rebuilt in 1958. The shrine is currently undergoing renovations bit by bit in preparation for its 100th anniversary, but will remain open.</p>

It was designed to evoke scenes from classical literature and mythology, but no context is necessary to appreciate the wooded walkways, stone bridges, central pond, trickling streams and wooden teahouses of this beautifully preserved garden. There is almost always something in bloom at Rikugi-en, though the garden is most famous for its maple leaves in late fall. Usually during late November and early December, the park stays open until 9pm. In spring, the highlight is the large weeping cherry tree near the entrance.</em>");
